# Gmail Notification Remover

![Before and After Picture](/docs/before_and_after.jpg)

This simple Firefox extension helps me avoid distractions by removing Gmail notifications
from the browser tab title. I built this after learning about my behaviours and habits from the book [*Tiny Habits* by BJ Fogg](https://tinyhabits.com/book/).

If you are interested in using this, shoot me a message at [machstg@gmail.com](mailto:machstg@gmail.com) 
and I'll publish it to the Firefox Add-Ons Store.

## Privacy

The extension only runs on `mail.google.com` webpages, and
the ONLY thing it does is modify the browser title. 
No data is ever collected or stored. You can read the code yourself, it's only 20 lines.
